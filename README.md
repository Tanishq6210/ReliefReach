## Project

I've developed a decentralized application called ReliefReach, which is based on blockchain technology. It's designed to facilitate transparent donations for various relief funds, with a particular emphasis on supporting those in need. The smart contract for this application is deployed on the Scroll and Mantle test network, and the data of the relief requests are stored in the TableLand database. Admin have the ability to insert new requests to the database, and I've implemented the Lit protocol for cases where someone may not have the public key they can generate the public key using lit protocol and google authentication. This ensures that every contribution is recorded in a secure and transparent manner, allowing for greater trust and accountability in the relief fund ecosystem.
